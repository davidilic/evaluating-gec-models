As a result, there were not even good facilities for moving from place to place. This was because there were no companies to build cars. In about 10 years, car trading became viable and was strongly supported by its fans. At first, it faced many problems, but it was able to solve them by the end.\n\nNowadays, all methods of travel are more convenient, from cars to buses, even trains and planes. Some people prefer cars because they do not like crowded places or because they find it sometimes cheaper. However, from another point of view, public transportation is very cheap and even faster. But when it comes to traveling long distances, many people prefer riding their own cars to feel the real experience and to enjoy themselves by relaxing in less crowded places.\n\nTo summarize, it is a matter of opinion. I predict that public transportation will improve, and people will use it more and more. By the end, cars may disappear, and we will no longer use them."

It's horrible to have a person behind you all the time; you have no life, no peace, no happiness.\n\nIn addition, all persons have the right to privacy and to be free.\nHowever, journalists stay with them all the time, taking photos, whether they are eating, drinking, happy, sad, asking about their love life and who they're with, even if it's something important or what they buy.\n\nThis is terrible; you don't have privacy although society may blame them, because if they don't take photos or follow the lives of famous people, the public will be bored.\n\nSo, politicians and film stars should support it, because then they will have to endure it, because they will then receive the rewards for what they earn.\n\nThis is all."
